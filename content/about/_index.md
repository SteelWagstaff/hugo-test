# Welcome!

![Steel Wagstaff](/images/steel_headshot.jpg "Steel Wagstaff")  
**What I do:** I'm the educational product manager for [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com), a small Canadian startup which makes [open source book publishing software](https://pressbooks.org). I live in Eugene, Oregon (the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people and a part of the Cascadia bioregion).

**What I've done:** I've spent much of my adulthood teaching or supporting others who teach at universities. I earned a Ph.D. in English and a master's degree in Library and Information Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I've worked outside the academy as a land surveyor, prison educator, and mentor/tutor for elementary school-aged kids.

**What I love:** Being a father and partner and friend. Poetry (with special affection for [the 'Objectivists'](https://theobjectivists.org/)), music, libraries, pickup soccer, & vegetarian food. Empiricism, generosity, compassion for all sentient beings.
